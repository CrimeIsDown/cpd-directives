</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;">We are members of an elite and highly trained profession: law enforcement.  We will conduct ourselves in a manner that is consistent with professional standards. These standards include the adherence to our Mission Statement and our Core Values. We hold ourselves and each other accountable for our actions.  Professionalism means having a corporate and personal set of standards for performance. We aspire to high ideals: altruism; honor; respect; scholarship; caring, compassion, and communication; leadership; and responsibility.</div>

</table>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Our obligation is a requirement to take action, be that action either legal or moral.  It is a compulsion; we are compelled to act.  As police officers, we have the legal obligation to serve and protect the residents of the City of Chicago, and the legal requirement to preserve order and uphold the law.  However, our obligation runs deeper than just legal requirements.  For us, there is an obligation to service that is tied directly to personal honor.  We act not just because of our legal authority, but because of our personal <span class="WysiwygItalic">duty</span>.  </div>

<div class="ListItemPara">
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" class="ListItemParaNum">3.</td><td>Leadership</td>

</table>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Leadership is influencing people - by providing purpose, direction, and motivation &ndash; while operating to accomplish a mission and improve the organization.  Each member is expected and encouraged to be a leader.  By combining personal knowledge, job skill, and obligation, we are leaders in the community.  With a positive attitude and the commitment to our fellow members, we are leaders among our peers in both the Chicago Police Department and the law enforcement profession.  We seek out challenging situations and circumstances in order to thrive as leaders: never looking to avoid conflict but instead seeking to resolve it.</div>

<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" class="ListItemParaNum">4.</td><td>Integrity</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Integrity, the adherence to moral and ethical principles and the consistency of actions which are value-based, is our standard.  We will conduct ourselves in a manner that gains the trust and respect of those whom we serve. We are of strong character, possessing the personal values and mental and emotional attributes that enable us to make ethical decisions and empathize with others.  We do what is right not because it brings us personal recognition, but because it is the right thing to do.  </div>

<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" class="ListItemParaNum">5.</td><td>Courage</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather its mastery.  We will remain courageous in our actions. We recognize that there are two types of courage: physical courage and moral courage.  Physical courage is recognizing danger to oneself or to others, but persisting in our duty regardless. Moral courage is the adherence to principle, integrity, and obligation no matter how convenient it may be to do otherwise.  It is putting character ahead of expediency; of putting what is right ahead of what may be popular.  We fulfill our obligation and are leaders because of our courage.</div>

<div class="ListItemPara">

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;">We recognize that excellence is not an end state, but rather a continuing process.  We will continue to seek out innovative ways to work with the members of the community we serve in order to achieve the highest level of quality in our service.  We will strive for creative and effective solutions to crime and disorder, and we will work to be the symbol for excellence in the law enforcement profession.</div>
