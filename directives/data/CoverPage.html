<div class="ListType List">
<ul class="Disk">
<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">The Department directives are organized into the following classifications: General Order, Special Order, Employee Resource, Uniform and Property, and Department Notice (listed under "Other Directives").</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;"></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">Each classification of directives is grouped into related topics or "Index Categories."  The navigation tree under the "Contents" tab can be expanded to each individual directive, giving a clear view of the structure.  Additionally, the structure is outlined in the Department Directives System Index (CPD-11.716).</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;"></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">Directives are numbered by classification and category rather than merely by date of issue. This gives directives a permanent number for easy reference and recall. Revisions to directives will be announced by the Research and Development Division and identified by the new "Effective Date."</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;"></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">Some directives are split to separate policy (General Order) from specific procedures (Special Order).  When looking for information, determine if a Department directive has a companion or related directive in another classification.  These "splits" are identified in the the "Purpose" section of the affected directives as well as in Department Directives System Index (CPD-11.716).  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;"></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">The DDS also contains various Department Resources including various "Guides and Manuals" (e.g., Rules and Regulations of the Chicago Police Department, Incident Reporting Guide), Department Forms,  and Collective Bargaining Agreements.  These resources can be found by navigating from the "Contents" Tab to Resources.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;"></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="ListItemPara">The DDS offers users an enhanced search capability and interactive documents. The system has the ability to link documents to one another for easy cross-reference and to display other items such as linked glossary terms and contact information in pop-up windows.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.5in;"></div>
