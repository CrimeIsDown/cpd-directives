The consumption of intoxicants, therefore, cannot be tolerated while a member is on duty, except to the minimum requirements of a specific police assignment.  Every member must also be constantly aware that while technically off duty he is subject to respond to any emergency requiring his service.

This policy of absolute neutrality and impartiality is seriously threatened and potentially undermined if the labor organization or union involved in the dispute is in any way associated with the representation of law enforcement of the law enforcement profession.

The Police Board shall conduct a hearing within 30 days after the suspension, unless the hearing is continued with the agreement of the member, which hearing will follow the same procedures as a hearing for a suspension in excess of 30 days. The substance of that hearing by the Police board or its hearing officer shall be limited to the issue of whether the member has been precluded from lawfully carrying a firearm &mdash; whether by judicial order, including as a condition of bond, or by applicable law or ordinance &mdash; and shall not include any findings or review regarding the underlying felony or misdemeanor or other legal infraction giving rise to the legal prohibition on theat member&rsquo;s carrying a firearm. A suspension under this Article is non-disciplinary and shall not preclude the filing of charges and imposition of disciplinary actions against a member found guilty of violating any other Department rule or regulation. The Superintendent may allow the member to use compensatory time earned and/or accumulated vacation/furlough time prior to placement of the member into a no pay status. At such time as the legal prohibition on a member&rsquo;s carrying a firearm ends, the member may apply to the Police Board for reinstatement, subject to the Superintendent&rsquo;s determination that the member is otherwise fit for duty.</div>
